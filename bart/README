CS75 project2 - BART

The purpose of this project is to create an interactive map of San Francisco showing train routes for the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART)
system.  The user selects their desired route from the main page and the stops for the chosen route appear on the map.  The user can then
get real-time schedules for the various stops by clicking on their icons.

This project uses php, javascript, and SQL and utilizes the Google Maps API and the BART API.
